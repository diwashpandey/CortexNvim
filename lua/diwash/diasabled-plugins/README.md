# Optional / Disabled Plugins

This folder contains **Neovim plugins that are disabled by default**.  
All plugins here are **fully configured and ready to use**, but are **not loaded automatically** in the default setup.

## Purpose

- Provide plugins that were previously used or replaced.  
- Offer additional plugins that users **might want to enable**.  
- Allow users to add extra functionality **without affecting the main setup**.

## How to Enable a Plugin

To use any plugin from this folder:  

1. Move the plugin from:
` ~/.config/nvim/lua/diwash/disabled-plugins/<Plugin> `
to:
` ~/.config/nvim/lua/diwash/plugins/<Plugin> `

**And you're ready to go**

* The plugin is now automatically loaded and ready to use.  
* No additional configuration is needed—everything is pre-configured (Yeah you can tweak it if you want)

## Notes
- Plugins here are **optional**; moving them is the only step needed to enable them.  
- You can explore, enable, or modify any plugin as desired.  
- Keep this folder updated if new optional plugins are added in the future.
